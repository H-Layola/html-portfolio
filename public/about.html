<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Han and I am a learner at Udemy. 
  This year I have decided to learn about Web Development. 
  I always think it is cool to become a full-stack developer. 
  The idea of having that knowledge to build a website, design it to the preferences and be as creative as much as possible are the reasons why I want to study this. 
  It is like building a house except through coding, hoping that it will work as there are no missing pieces or errors. </p>

<p>I hope after I get into deep into this course will give me more reasons why I’d like to become a programmer. 
  Not only do I like building things but I also like the idea of having some projects as I do in my real life like small DIY.  
  However, this time I won’t be needing my tools like my screwdriver, driller, measuring tape, hammer and all those tools in order to finish the task. 
  This time just the ability to know the codes. The ability to accept a project later and get it done with satisfaction. </p>

<p>I know I still have a long way to finish the course but I am excited to have that kind of skills and confidence. 
  I also know that it requires time, dedication and lots of practice in order for me to achieve this goal.
  I hope to see myself one day typing away, freelancing and accepting projects from companies that will help me grow as a real professional programmer. </p>
