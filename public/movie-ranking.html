<h2>Catch Me If You Can</h2>
    <p>New Rochelle, the 1960s. High schooler, Frank Abagnale Jr., 
    idolizes his father, who's in trouble with the IRS. When his parents separate, 
    Frank runs away to Manhattan with $25 in his checking account, vowing to regain dad's losses and get his parents back together. 
    Just a few years later, the FBI tracks him down in France; he's extradited, tried, and jailed for passing more than $4,000,000 in bad checks. 
    Along the way, he's posed as a Pan Am pilot, a pediatrician, and an attorney.
    And, from nearly the beginning of this life of crime, he's been pursued by a dour FBI agent, Carl Hanraty. 
    What starts as cat and mouse becomes something akin to father and son.</p>
